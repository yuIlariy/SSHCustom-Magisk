# Belt-and-suspenders iptables cleanup. The Go daemon does its own cleanup
# in iptables.Cleanup() during shutdown, but if the daemon crashed or was
# killed mid-rule, leftover SSHC_* chains could remain and silently break
# the device's networking. This script is callable from sshcustom.sh stop
# and from customize.sh during a fresh install to guarantee a clean slate.
#
# Removes every SSHC_* chain name we have ever shipped (current and legacy)
# from both the IPv4 and IPv6 nat tables, plus the FORWARD ACCEPT rule that
# hotspot mode adds. Errors are silenced because every -D against a missing
# rule is harmless noise.
